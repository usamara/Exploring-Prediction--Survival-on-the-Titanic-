# Exploring Prediction- Survival on the Titanic 

This project aims to analyze whether passengers survived the Titanic disaster based on various input parameters and features. Features such as passenger class, fare, age, gender & family size.

The project will study and analyze to better assess risks associated with maritime travel. Identify the key factors that contributed to survival during the Titanic disaster. Understanding these can help in risk assessment for future travel ventures or emergency planning in the hospitality and travel industries.

### Methods:
We will focus on creating some illustrative data visualizations. For the predictive modeling, I’ll be using a randomForest algorithm to predict survival on the Titanic. My script is divided into three parts:
1.	Feature Engineering
2.	Missing Value Imputation
3.	Prediction!
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To understand the distribution and survival trends in the data based on age, sex, class.
•	Data Visualization: Visualizations that highlight key findings.
•	Regression Analysis: In this analysis, we are going to use

## Data File
[Data File- Test ](https://github.com/usamara/Exploring-Prediction--Survival-on-the-Titanic-/blob/main/test.csv)
[Data File -  Training ](https://github.com/usamara/Exploring-Prediction--Survival-on-the-Titanic-/blob/main/train.csv)
[Data File - Gender Submission](https://github.com/usamara/Exploring-Prediction--Survival-on-the-Titanic-/blob/main/gender_submission.csv)

### Data Explanation:
Here is the list of files
There are three files in the data: 
1. train.csv
2. test.csv and 
3. gender_submission.csv.
In this dataset
•	if survived is "1", the passenger survived.
•	if survived is "0", the passenger died.
